        <p>
            I'm currently 18 years old and live in Waterloo, IA with two brothers named Leif and Thomas. Leif is about 15 years old currently attending school as a Freshmen at Waterloo West High and Thomas is about 12 years old and is in 8th grade, currently at Hoover Middle School. I like to play video games, primarily on an Xbox One, but I also love to play on a PC or Playstation if you put it in front of me. I also love to spend time indoors by the fire during Winter drinking hot chocolate, but you might also find me outside during the Summer enjoying the weather probably swimming.
